## Hi there, I'm Gabi 👋

As a journalist-turned-**Data Analyst** based in the Netherlands, I enjoy finding stories in data, solving puzzles, and occasionally baking cakes (when I need a break from the first two).

My mother tongue is Portuguese, my **SQL** is as sharp as my Spanish, and my **Python** is definitely better than my Dutch. Oh, and I speak fluent English—with a side of sarcasm.

Feel free to explore my work, and if you're a fellow data nerd—or a Star Trek fan—let's connect. 🖖🏼
