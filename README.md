## Hi there, I'm Gabi 👋

I'm a Journalist-turned-**Data Analist** based in the Netherlands. I like diving into new data, solving problems and baking cakes - not always in this order. 

My mother tonge is Portuguese. My **SQL** is as good as my Spanish. My **Python** is better than my Dutch. And I'm fluent in English and sarcasm.

Please, feel free to poak around - and to send me a message if you're looking for a project buddy for a Star Trek Data Analysis. 🖖🏼
